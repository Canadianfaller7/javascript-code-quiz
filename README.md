# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description
- This is a web application that tests your basic knowledge on the fundamentals of Javascript! It will tell you how the quiz works and will start a timer once you click the "start quiz" button. This application was built by manipulating the html and DOM to make elements, hide elements and display others to get the questions to display on screen, to also display a new time if the user selects the wrong answer, add a certain amount of points to each right answer and give the user a final score at the end of the quiz and then allow the user to use the localStorage to save their name and score into a highscore section and remove it from localStorage if they'd like.
- As I went through this project, I was able to learn more about how to use more JavaScript in general and how to look through arrays and objects to get the correct items I needed to call to get my quiz to display the answers and questions on the screen, to see if the answer the user selected was correct or wrong. I learned how to manipulate the DOM better using JavaScript and to better my basic knowledge and skills.
